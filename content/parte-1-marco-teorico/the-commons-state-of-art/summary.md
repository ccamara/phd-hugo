After having set the historical rise and decay of the commons, in this
chapter, we have acknowledged that there is a current rebirth of the
commons that has resulted in a myriad of new types of commons. These
so-called new commons, in turn, pose endless interpretations of the
concept of the commons to the point that almost everything can be
conceptualised as a common. As a result, and as we have been arguing
during the last part of this chapter, the attempts to define the commons
become cumbersome and either too narrow or too general. However, we can
sketch three ways of approaching the commons in current literature: the
three conceptions that are thoroughly explained in next chapter.
