The end of 20<sup>th</sup> century has supposed a second resurgence of the
commons, as they have gone from being almost unnoticed for scholars to
be studied from various disciplines (namely Ecology, Law, Sociology or
Politics, just to mention a few): many articles, books and special
issues have been written covering different aspects of the commons, and
even dedicated institutions[^51] and publications[^52] have been
founded, to the point that authors like Laval and Dardot (2014/2015, p.
22) defend that they have become an academic discipline in their own
right: the *commons' studies*, which currently comprises almost all the
social sciences' studies (Laerhoven y Ostrom, 2007, p. 6). But commons
are not only present in academia: they have become part of the
vocabulary of non-academic discourses and anti-globalisation and social
justice movements to the point that possibly the commons are currently
more present outside academia than in it.

There are many reasons for such an explosion of commons: exogenous, like
the ones outlined in the introduction (growingly aggressive neo-liberal
policies, global crisis) and endogenous, like the reflexive work of key
scholars such as Elinor Ostrom and Antonio Negri, the existence of study
cases or the foundation of the International Association for the Study
of the Common Property in 1989[^53]. But one of the main reasons is that
it is such an appealing concept, and apparently easy to define, that it
is indeed tempting to apply the idea of a collectively managed resource
to most facets of life[^54], such as knowledge and culture (Hess y
Ostrom, 2007), social relationships, music, health (Smith-Nonini, 2007),
genetics (Cunningham, 2014) or even supranational and global resource
domains (such as the atmosphere, outer space or cyberspace (Soroos,
2010; Stern, 2011)) and, as we will further elaborate, cities. These
"new commons", as they are often referred to, give a new dimension to
concepts that despite are not new, they had never been studied from the
collective action perspective[^55]. Unfortunately, such an apparently
simple and enormously suggestive idea is, in fact, an incredibly complex
concept with multiple facets (political, social, urban, technological)
and its meaning and scope is an issue of much controversy and debate. As
Leif Jerram points out:

> For Elinor Ostrom \[\...\] 'commons' could be almost anything -including
> knowledge and computer code (Hess & Ostrom, 2007; Ostrom, 1990). For
> \[\...\] Jeremy Németh the commons can be thought of as a whole range of
> things, from libraries, through the Internet, sidewalks, light from a
> streetlamp, to the atmosphere or some food \[\...\]. And Hardt and Negri
> \[\...\] define the commons (though they call it 'the common') in yet
> another way, unconnected to the others: the common is that valuable part
> of something, the value of which is not determined by its use value, or
> labor inputs, but created and given freely by potential users, like the
> trendiness of a bar (Jerram, 2015, p. 47).

This poses an indeed a problematic issue that derives from such a
diverse concept. There are two opposed approximations to remedy this
situation: the first one consists of providing a more generic
interpretation of the commons that may fit on different contexts.
Whereas the other one consists of creating a new taxonomy of the commons
that may allow a classification of several subsets (or sub-species) of
the commons that share specific sets of features. In the following
chapters, we will examine how scholars have been tackling this
disambiguation from the perspective of this two positions.

## Redefining the commons

One of the first scholars who systematically studied the commons was
Elinor Ostrom, who defined them as "a series of common-pool resources
and public goods which are difficult, although not impossible, to
exclude other people from" (Ostrom, Gardner, y Walker, 1994, pp. 6-7).
As we will see in chapter 3.1, at that time, Ostrom was referring to a
specific subset of natural resources (Common Pool Resources, to be more
precise) that were collectively managed by a community. A similar
definition, yet in a completely different context, would be given
sixteen years later by Yochai Benkler, who underlined that one of the
most salient points of the common, no matter its nature, is the fact
that:

> As opposed to property, is that no single person has exclusive control
> over the use and disposition of any particular resource in the commons.
> Instead, resources governed by commons may be used or disposed of by
> anyone among some (more or less well-defined) number of persons, under
> rules that may range from 'anything goes' to quite crisply articulated
> formal rules that are effectively enforced (Benkler, 2006, p. 61).

Both definitions share the fact that they provide a more comprehensive
notion of property and they are focused on access to a common, which in
both cases is a shared resource. However, Benkler did not have in mind
natural resources, as Ostrom did, but something more intangible:
software or knowledge, which obviously have entirely different
characteristics.

Such differences in the resources' nature have led other authors to
focus not on the resource itself or the notions of property but on the
communities that manage them and the social relations that are
established between them. For example John L. Sullivan, states that

> A commons arises whenever a given community decides that it wishes to
> manage a resource in a collective manner, with special regard for
> equitable access, use, and sustainability. The commons is a means by
> which individuals can band together with like-minded souls and express a
> sovereignty of their own (Sullivan, 2011, p. 234)[^56].

Amita Baviskar and Vinay Gidwani, portray commons as goods or resources
which involve practices that rely on communities (thus denoting a logic
of social relations) and, as such:

> \[Commons\] involve 'being-in-common', or using resources in more or
> less shared, more or less non-subtractable ways through practices he
> \[historian Peter Linebaugh\] calls 'commoning'. Such collective
> practices are distinct in at least two ways: (1) they underwrite
> production and reproduction through the commons they depend upon and
> oversee, and (2) they typically do so through variable local
> arrangements that are more or less equalitarian, incorporative, and
> fair. In short, commons need communities: without sufficiently robust
> communities of people willing to create, maintain, and protect them,
> commons are at risk of falling into disarray or becoming privatised
> (Baviskar y Gidwani, 2011).

By contrast, others like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2009, p. viii)
put both aspects of the commons --the resource and the community-- on
the same balance and define the commons both as a *natural good* (the
natural environment, its resources and the products they yield) and a
*human product* (the products of social interaction, such as codes,
languages, affects, information and other forms of knowledge).

Other scholars define the commons in a negative way, this is, as an
opposition to something, being enclosures[^57], market and capitalism
the most quoted ones. These concepts are very interlinked and sometimes
are used almost as synonyms by following a reasoning like this one:
"enclosures destroyed the commons in order to favour capitalism which,
pursuing the ideal of free market, only seeks economic profit". Under
this perspective, commons and capitalism are two opposing forces in
constant conflict and what benefits one, harms the other[^58]. Massimo
de Angelis (2006, p. 147), exemplifies that reasoning by stating that
"New enclosures, thus are directed towards the fragmentation and
destruction of 'commons'" and, as a result, commons could be considered
as "social spheres of life the main characteristics of which are to
provide various degrees of protection from the market". However,
Reinhold Martin (2013) warned that the commons are not just to be
considered as a merely post-industrial upgrade of the modern state
historically linked to the rise of capitalism, as they represent a
different way. In order to support his claim, he quotes Hardt and Negri
by saying that "what the private is to capitalism and what the public is
to socialism, the common is to communism" (Hardt y Negri, 2009, p. 273).
A similar reasoning is also shared by other authors like Observatori
Metropolità de Barcelona (OMB) members who state that commons represent
an alternative to the dichotomies market/estate and private/public.
According to them, commons are social institutions based in local,
communitarian and participative practises, aimed to provide answers to
social demands and are managed in a non-market management of the
resources (Observatori Metropolità de Barcelona, 2014). From this point
of view, the words of Sullivan get a new perspective when he states that
commons are a "vehicle by which new sorts of self-organised publics can
gather together and exercise new types of citizenship". Hence, they can
even serve as a viable alternative to "markets that have grown stodgy,
manipulative, and coercive" (Sullivan, 2011, p. 234), and that
perspective is mostly used in current framing of urban commons.

From all these different conceptions and perspectives of the commons, we
can state that all of them share the fact that commons are based on the
action of sharing something between the members of a particular
community. It is precisely that community the one that manages (governs)
the commons and, in most cases, it does so in a non-market relation,
this is: they do not look for economic profit. Laval and Dardot share
this point of view and state that it is precisely the existence of a
communitarian and democratic management of the commons what gives
commons a meaning: *"Lo que da sentido a la reunión de estos diferentes
aspectos de los comunes en una designación única es la exigencia de una
nueva forma de gestión 'comunitaria' y democrática de los recursos
comunes, más responsable, más duradera y más justa"* (Laval & Dardot,
2014/2015, p. 111). However, it is also true that apart from that, not
only the term commons is used to designate very different things (Common
Pool Resources, social relations, communities, software, cities\...),
but there is no consensus on its definition, or, quoting Maja Hojer
Bruun: "with so many different uses of 'commons' it is probably
impossible to formulate one generic definition of commons or to define
one set of features that covers all the different kinds of existing and
emergent commons" (Bruun, 2015, p. 154). As a result, this approach of
trying to provide a generic definition has not solved the problem of
commons' disambiguation but has made things worse: the meaning of the
commons has been broadened to such an extent that it could be argued
that it has lost any meaning, as almost anything could fit on it and has
often been used uncritically. As Sevilla-Buitrago states, the commons,
then, seem to be more of a conglomerate of certain values or diffuse
aspirations: *"Los comunes ---término que en la acepción inglesa que lo
ha popularizado (the commons) se refiere tanto a la condición de lo
común como a los espacios y recursos específicos para el soporte de la
comunidad--- se han convertido en el nodo alrededor del cual se
condensan toda una serie de estrategias, deseos y aspiraciones más o
menos difusas"* (Sevilla-Buitrago, 2013). For this reason, Leif Jerram
points out that it is easier to conclude that commons are associated
with two moods: "good" and "old". "The commons is good but it is also
old" (Jerram, 2015, p. 48), although he alerts that this notion of
historicity has to be questioned, "because it poses profound problems
for the imaginary projects of commons activists" (Jerram, 2015, p. 48).

## A new taxonomy for the commons

In opposition to try to provide a generic definition that may include
all the possible types of commons, several authors have tried to create
new taxonomies for the commons that would allow their classification
according to specific features. In fact, scholars like Yochai Benkler or
Charlotte Hess provided a generic definition but later on were forced to
provide a classification that would narrow an otherwise too generic
definition as well as would allow them to identify different sets of
features shared between commons of the same type.

At the end of her career, Ostrom developed, alongside Charlotte Hess and
their colleagues at the Workshop in Politechnical Theory and Policy
Analysis at Indiana University the Institutional Analysis and
Development (IAD) framework aimed to analyse knowledge as a common (Hess
& Ostrom, 2007). That framework ultimately led them to study new types
of commons of different types and nature that they grouped according to
two parameters: degree of exclusion and subtractability, which resulted
in the 2x2 matrix that can be seen in table 2.1.

|               |               | **Subtractability**   |                       |
| --------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|               |               | **Low**               | **High**              |
| **Exclusion** | **Difficult** | <ul><li>Public goods</li><li>Useful knowledge</li><li>Sunsets </li> </ul>| <ul><li>Common-Pool Resources</li><li>Libraries</li><li>Irrigation systems </li> </ul>|

_Tabl. 2.1: Types of goods classification. Source: Hess & Ostrom (2007)_

Although Ostrom would not go any further on this topic, Charlotte Hess
continued her research on what she called "non-traditional Common Pool
Resources". She observed that, due to the emergence of new technologies
that allowed the capture of previously uncapturable public goods (such
as the Internet, genetic data, outer space...) on the one hand and to
the reconceptualization[^59] as commons of already existing publicly
shared resources (like streets, playgrounds, urban gardens,
hospitals...) on the other, a myriad of "new commons"[^60] emerged at
the end of 20<sup>th</sup> century. These new types of commons did not have any
connection to traditional commons studied by Ostrom and, consequently,
introduced an enormous diversity difficult to tackle without taking into
account their own set of differences. As a result, she proposed a
mapping of these new commons into the following main sectors according
to their type of resources: *cultural commons; neighbourhood commons;
knowledge commons; social commons; infrastructure commons; market
commons; and global commons.* In turn, she provided several examples of
commons within these sectors and their subsectors, resulting in the
exhaustive mind map displayed in the figure 2.2. However, her mapping
was problematic too: as she admitted (Hess, 2008, p. 5), such
classification in groups was somewhat arbitrary, as there were evident
overlaps between sectors in some cases and there were some groups which
had a clear physical dimension whereas others were in fact examples of
social groups or collective action.

{{< figure src="/img/cap2/hess-mapping-commons.png" title="Fig. 2.2. Charlotte Hess' mapping of the \"New Commons\"." numbered="true" >}}

On the other hand, Yochai Benkler made an entirely different
classification, as his proposal resulted from the combination of two
parameters: "The first parameter is whether they are open to anyone or
only to a defined group. \[...\] The second parameter is whether a
commons is regulated or unregulated" (Benkler, 2006, p. 61). This
combination of variables results in four types of commons that are
summarised in Table 2.2 below.

| Paramter   | Variation  | Examples  | Notes |
| -----------|------------|-----------|------ |
| Openness   | Open to anyone                | Oceans, air, highway system  |   |
|            | Open to a defined group only  | Pasture arrangements and most of Ostrom's CPRs described on Governing the Commons are of limited-access | "These are better thought of as limited common property regimes, rather than commons, because they behave as property vis-à-vis the entire world except members of the group who together hold them in common"  |
| Regulation | Regulated   | Sidewalks, streets, roads and highways  | The constraints, if any, are symmetric among all users and cannot be regulated by a single individual  |
|            | Unregulated | Air  |   |

_Tabl. 2.2: Benkler's taxonomy for the commons._

Other examples of classifications are the ones provided by Bru Lain
Escandell (2015a), who distinguishes between natural and digital commons
(each of them with their own set of features, challenges and problems);
by Hardt and Negri, whose two types are divided into the common wealth
of the material world (water, air, soil\...) and the results of social
production that are necessary for social interaction and further
production (knowledge, languages\...)[^61]; or by International
Globalization Forum[^62] (a research, advocacy and action organization),
which Ana Lucía Gutiérrez Espeleta and Flavio Mora Moraga (2011, p. 129)
summarise as the following three type of common goods. The first of them
are natural biological resources upon which human life depends on
(examples of this group include water, air, soil, woods, fisheries...
--this group, hence, would be the same as the CPRs portrayed by Elinor
Ostrom). The second group of collective cultural creations which
includes knowledge and culture. And the third one encomprises social
commons aimed to guarantee public access to health, education and social
security. This somewhat generic classification pushes Gutiérrez Espeleta
and Mora Moraga to make their own proposal conceptualising commons as
follows:

1.  Commons **as a resource:** the emphasis here is put on an object
    which does not belong to a single person or entity but is shared by
    a group or community. This kind of commons are "things" that belong
    to anyone by the sole fact of belonging to the human race and thus
    respond to the "common interest".

2.  Commons as **social relations**: what defines a common is not the
    resource *per se* but the groups of people that are formed around it
    in order to collectively manage it and the type relationships that
    are woven between their members.

3.  Commons as resources leading to **political action**: the emphasis
    is put on the political motivation and organisation oriented to
    achieve certain results aligned to their claims.

In fact, Gutiérrez Espeleta and Mora Moraga are well aware that the
limits between these groups are blurry and, hence, state that these are
not exclusive options but complementary, which doesn't help much in the
classification of the commons.

With such a variety of diverse classifications, we attempted to create
our own one summarising some of the previous ones and resulting in the
following table:

| **Resource**    | **Examples**    | **Scholars**    | **Features**    |
| ----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Natural resources | Forests, meadows, moors, water, fisheries\...      | Ostrom, Bollier | Exclusive, limited |
| Culture and knowledge  | Creative commons' licences, books and writings, music, pictures\...    | Lessig, Hess, Ostrom  | Non-exclusive   |
| Technology      | FLOSS, Open Hardware          | Stallman, Benkler     | Non-exclusive   |
| Cities and urbanism     | Communitarian equipments  | Harvey          | Non-exclusive   |
| Genetic materials      |                 | Scharper and Cunningham   |                 |
| Food            | Soilent         | \-              | Exclusive       |
| Energy          | Somenergia      |                 | Exclusive/Non-exclusive |

_Tabl. 2.3: Commons' taxonomy proposal according to the type of resource._

Unfortunately, any of these attempts to classify the commons can easily
be refuted because it is not possible to cover the whole spectrum of the
commons. However, these attempts evidence an emergent tendency
consisting of adding an adjective to the term "common" in order to
narrow its meaning. An example of this tendency is the term "urban
commons", which are the study object of this research and will be
further developed in upcoming chapters.

The reasons for such failure are either because the selection criteria
are not clear or because despite being clear, they do not suffice to
classify the great variety of things, relationships and challenges that
exist worldwide and beyond which are often referred to as "commons". But
their main problem is that all these classifications share the fact that
they conceptualize the commons basically as shared resources, whereas as
Gutiérrez Espeleta and Mora Moraga timidly introduced (and as we will
further elaborate on chapter 8) there are other dimensions of the
commons that go far beyond the resource itself. This perspective
enormously contributes to a broader understanding of the concept yet, at
the same time, introduces a far more considerably complexity that cannot
be tackled by any of the classifications provided above nor by providing
general definitions.


[^51]: Such as the "International Association for the Study of the
    Commons"
    ([[http://www.iasc-commons.org/]{.underline}](http://www.iasc-commons.org/)),
    a non-profit founded in 1989 to promote the understanding of
    institutions for the management of resources that are or could be
    held or used collectively as a commons by communities in developing
    and industrialized countries.

[^52]: Like the "International Journal of the Commons"
    ([[https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/]{.underline}](https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/)),
    an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed open-access journal, dedicated to
    furthering the understanding of institutions for use and management
    of resources that are (or could be) enjoyed collectively, being them
    part of natural world or created by humankind.

[^53]: As oultined by Van Laerhoven and Ostrom (2007), the International
    Association for the Study of the Common Property, that would become
    the International Association for the Study of the Commons in 2006
    to broaden its focus, was a consequence of these previous and
    important events that put together scholars of different
    disciplines: the series of symposia and workshops, organized by
    Bonnie McCay and James Acheson in 1983 and 1984, the establishment
    of the National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Common Property
    and the organization of a conference in Annapolis, Maryland in 1985
    (Laerhoven & Ostrom, 2007, pp. 4-5).

[^54]: Visit Nonini (2007)' for more information.

[^55]: As Maja Hojer Bruun states, "\'New commons\' are not necessary
    new per se, but framing collective resources such as knowledge or
    music as commons is a way of pointing out that these resources used
    to be or should be owned and managed collectively as a common good."
    (Bruun, 2015, p. 154).

[^56]: In this same essay about Open Source Software, Sullivan states
    that commons are a "vehicle by which new sorts of self-organized
    publics can gather together and exercise new types of citizenship"
    and thus they can even serve as a viable alternative to markets
    "that have grown stodgy, manipulative, and coercive", another topic
    that we will develop.

[^57]: The concept of "enclosures" is also being redefined, as it has
    also been used in recent literature in many different contexts and
    situations other than the parliamentary enclosures with more or less
    fortune. Most of the times the physical dimension of the enclosures
    (putting fences to a resource to prevent the access to it) has been
    omitted and the term "enclosure" is used as a synonym of
    "privatization", which according to Hodkinson is just a part of the
    enclosure itself, along with dispossession and capitalist
    subjectification, and it is only when the three aspects have taken
    place that we can talk about enclosures (Hodkinson, 2012, p. 515).

[^58]: Baviskar and Gidwani seem to go further stating that both can't
    coexist, as "The destruction of common resources and the communities
    that depend upon them is a long-standing outcome (some would argue,
    prerequisite) of capitalist expansion" (Baviskar y Gidwani, 2011, p.
    43), and Hodkinson argues that the creation of (Urban) commons
    prevents the expansion of capitalism (Hodkinson, 2012, p. 516).

[^59]: According to her, the conference organized by the International
    Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP) in 1995 with
    the theme "Reinventing the Commons" highly contributed to favour
    those reconceptualizations (Hess, 2008, pp. 2-4).

[^60]: Hess decided to rename "non-traditional Common Pool Resources"
    into "new commons" for two main reasons: "First, it indicates that
    there is something different about this kind of commons. Second, it
    challenges us to think about the general term 'commons' --a term
    frequently applied yet rarely defined" (Hess, 2008, p. 3).

[^61]: Hardt and Negri understand the common (in singular) as a
    combination of two types, being the first one "the common wealth of
    the material world---the air, the water, the fruits of the soil, and
    all nature\'s bounty --- which in classic European political texts
    is often claimed to be the inheritance of humanity as a whole, to be
    shared together." (Hardt & Negri, 2009, p. viii). The second type of
    commons, which they consider to be even more significant, includes
    "those results of social production that are necessary for social
    interaction and further production, such as knowledges, languages,
    codes, information, affects, and so forth" (Ibid.). As they both
    state, contrary to the environmental approach that we have developed
    on chapter 2.1, this notion of the common "does not position
    humanity separate from nature, as either its exploiter or its
    custodian, but focuses rather on the practices of interaction, care,
    and cohabitation in a common world, promoting the beneficial and
    limiting the detrimental forms of the common" (Hardt & Negri, 2009,
    p. viii).
